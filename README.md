# Ratkoja

Ratkoja is an application made for solving crossword puzzles, mainly the
[miniristikko](https://www.hs.fi/aihe/ristikko/)s at Helsingin Sanomat, but it
could probably be used for other crossword puzzles as well.

The main feature of Ratkoja is the list of possible words. You can fill in some
words or letters, and Ratkoja will show you what words could fit in the
column/row you are solving. Then you can browse through the candidates and
possibly get inspired from them.

Right now ratkoja only has a Finnish dictionary and that's missing other than
the standard forms of the words. In the future I want to include other
dictionaries and the possibility to upload your own.

Eventually the plan is to expand the solver we now have into
a crosswords-builder, where you can save the puzzle and others can try to solve
it without the solver, or maybe with the help of it.
